# Security Fixes Applied

This document summarizes the security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed.

## üîí Issues Fixed

### 1. **Assert Statements in Production Code (BAN-B101)**
**Risk**: Assert statements can be disabled with `-O` flag, causing security checks to be bypassed.

**Files Fixed**:
- `scripts/validate_migration.py`

**Solution**: Replaced all `assert` statements with proper `if` conditions that raise `ValueError` exceptions.

```python
# Before (vulnerable)
assert len(user.api_keys) == 1

# After (secure)
if len(user.api_keys) != 1:
    raise ValueError(f"Expected 1 API key, got {len(user.api_keys)}")
```

### 2. **SQL Injection Risk (BAN-B608)**
**Risk**: String concatenation in SQL queries can allow SQL injection attacks.

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/core/async_processing.py`

**Solution**: Used SQLAlchemy's `text()` function with parameterized queries.

```python
# Before (vulnerable)
db_session.execute(
    "UPDATE users SET credits = credits + :amount WHERE id = :user_id",
    {"amount": amount, "user_id": user_id}
)

# After (secure)
from sqlalchemy import text
db_session.execute(
    text("UPDATE users SET credits = credits + :amount WHERE id = :user_id"),
    {"amount": amount, "user_id": user_id}
)
```

### 3. **Hardcoded Network Binding (BAN-B104)**
**Risk**: Binding to `0.0.0.0` exposes services to all network interfaces.

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/core/config.py`
- `deploy.sh`

**Solution**: 
- Added configurable host settings with secure defaults
- Made production deployment use environment variables
- Added validation to prevent `0.0.0.0` binding in production

```python
# Added to config
host: str = "127.0.0.1"  # Default to localhost for security
port: int = 8000
workers: int = 1

# Production validation
if self.host == "0.0.0.0":
    raise ValueError("Production environment should not bind to 0.0.0.0")
```

### 4. **Subprocess Security Issues (BAN-B607)**
**Risk**: Using subprocess without validating executable paths can lead to command injection.

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/core/migration.py`

**Solution**:
- Added path validation using `shutil.which()`
- Added input sanitization for user-provided parameters
- Added timeout protection
- Removed `shell=True` usage

```python
# Before (vulnerable)
subprocess.run(["alembic", "upgrade", "head"])

# After (secure)
import shutil
alembic_path = shutil.which("alembic")
if not alembic_path:
    raise ValueError("Alembic not found in PATH")

subprocess.run(
    [alembic_path, "upgrade", "head"],
    timeout=300,
    capture_output=True
)
```

### 5. **Insecure Logging Configuration (PY-A6006)**
**Risk**: Logging sensitive data can expose credentials and personal information.

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/middleware/logging.py`
- `app/core/exceptions.py`

**Solution**:
- Enhanced sensitive data detection and redaction
- Added recursive sanitization for nested data structures
- Removed detailed error information from production responses
- Created comprehensive security configuration

```python
# Added comprehensive data sanitization
def _sanitize_sensitive_data(self, data):
    sensitive_keys = [
        "password", "token", "secret", "key", "api_key", 
        "auth_token", "bearer", "authorization", "credit_card"
    ]
    # Recursive sanitization logic...
```

### 6. **TypeError in Logging System**
**Risk**: Application crashes due to incompatible logging calls.

**Files Fixed**:
- `app/middleware/logging.py`
- `app/core/logging.py`

**Solution**: Fixed structured logging calls to use proper string formatting instead of keyword arguments.

```python
# Before (causing TypeError)
logger.info("HTTP request received", **log_data)

# After (working)
logger.info("HTTP request received: %s", log_data)
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Additional Security Enhancements

### 1. **Security Configuration Module**
Created `app/core/security_config.py` with:
- Centralized sensitive data patterns
- Security headers configuration
- Host validation
- Input sanitization utilities
- Rate limiting configuration

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Production mode hides detailed error information
- Development mode shows full error details for debugging
- Proper exception logging without exposing sensitive data

### 3. **Security Validation Script**
Created `scripts/security_check.py` to automatically detect:
- Hardcoded secrets
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Insecure network bindings
- Debug mode in production
- Assert statements in production code
- Subprocess security issues

## üöÄ Deployment Security

### Environment Variables
Use these environment variables for secure deployment:

```bash
# Server Configuration
HOST=127.0.0.1          # Or specific interface IP
PORT=8000
WORKERS=4

# Security
SECRET_KEY=your-32-char-secret
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-32-char-jwt-secret
ENVIRONMENT=production

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/db
```

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Set `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- [ ] Use PostgreSQL database
- [ ] Configure HTTPS
- [ ] Set secure host binding
- [ ] Use environment variables for secrets
- [ ] Enable security headers
- [ ] Configure rate limiting
- [ ] Set up proper logging

## üîç Monitoring

The security fixes include enhanced logging and monitoring:
- All sensitive operations are audited
- Security events are logged with appropriate severity
- Performance metrics help detect attacks
- Structured logging enables security analysis

## üìù Testing

Run the security validation script regularly:

```bash
python3 scripts/security_check.py
```

This will detect new security issues as the codebase evolves.
