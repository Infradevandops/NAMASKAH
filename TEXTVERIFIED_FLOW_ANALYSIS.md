# TextVerified API Flow Analysis & Refactoring Plan

## Current TextVerified API Understanding

### Authentication Flow
1. **Initial Auth**: POST `/api/pub/v2/auth` with API key and email headers
2. **Token Response**: Returns JWT token valid for ~1 hour
3. **Token Usage**: Bearer token in Authorization header for all subsequent requests

### SMS Verification Flow
1. **Create Verification**: POST `/api/pub/v2/verifications`
   ```json
   {
     "serviceName": "telegram",
     "capability": "sms",
     "areaCode": "212",     // Optional
     "carrier": "verizon"   // Optional
   }
   ```
2. **Response**: 201 status with Location header containing verification ID
3. **Get Details**: GET `/api/pub/v2/verifications/{id}`
   - Returns: number, state, carrier, country
4. **Check Messages**: GET `/api/pub/v2/sms?reservationId={id}`
   - Returns: array of SMS messages
5. **Cancel**: POST `/api/pub/v2/verifications/{id}/cancel`

### Voice Verification Flow
1. **Create Voice Verification**: Same as SMS but with `"capability": "voice"`
2. **Voice Details**: Same endpoint, returns voice-specific data
3. **Voice Messages**: Same SMS endpoint (may include transcription)
4. **Cancel**: Same cancel endpoint

### Key Insights
- Both SMS and voice use the same endpoints
- Only difference is the `capability` field
- Phone numbers are different for SMS vs voice
- State tracking: `verificationPending` â†’ `verificationCompleted`
- Messages endpoint works for both SMS and voice

## Refactoring Plan

### 1. Enhanced Verification Flow
- Unified SMS/Voice creation with capability selection
- Real-time status polling with WebSocket-like updates
- Better error handling and retry mechanisms
- Improved UI feedback and progress indicators

### 2. Dashboard Improvements
- Cleaner service selection with search/filter
- Real-time verification status updates
- Better mobile responsiveness
- Streamlined verification history

### 3. TextVerified Integration Enhancements
- Automatic token refresh handling
- Circuit breaker pattern for API failures
- Better carrier and area code support
- Enhanced message parsing and code extraction

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- Progressive disclosure of advanced options
- Better visual feedback for verification states
- Improved error messages and recovery options
- Mobile-first responsive design
