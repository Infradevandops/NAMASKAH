    // Pre-fill email if user is logged in
    const userEmail = document.getElementById('user-email')?.textContent;

    }
}
```

    const res = await fetch(`${API_BASE}/support/submit`, {
        method: 'POST',
        headers,
        body: JSON.stringify({ name, email, category, message })
    });
}
