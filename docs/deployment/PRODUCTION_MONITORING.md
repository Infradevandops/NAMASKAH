# Production Monitoring Checklist

**Status:** Waiting for deployment  
**Last Check:** 2024-10-17

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Current State:
- ✅ Code pushed to GitHub (commit: 3f6b3d2)
- ⏳ Waiting for production deployment
- ❌ Domain not accessible yet (namaskah.app)

### What Was Deployed:
1. TextVerified API health check (every 5 minutes)
2. Database connection pooling (20 connections)
3. Response compression (GZip)
4. Request logging (all API calls)

---

## ✅ Verification Steps (Run After Deployment)

### Step 1: Basic Health Check
```bash
# Check if site is up
curl https://your-domain.com/health

# Expected response:
# {"status": "healthy", "service": "namaskah-sms", ...}
```

### Step 2: API Status Check
```bash
# Check service status endpoint
curl https://your-domain.com/services/status

# Expected: JSON with service categories and API health
```

### Step 3: Compression Check
```bash
# Verify GZip compression is working
curl -I https://your-domain.com/services/list | grep -i "content-encoding"

# Expected: Content-Encoding: gzip
```

### Step 4: Status Page Check
```bash
# Open status page in browser
open https://your-domain.com/status

# Expected: Page shows "TextVerified API: Operational"
```

### Step 5: Response Time Check
```bash
# Measure response time
time curl -s https://your-domain.com/services/list > /dev/null

# Expected: < 0.5 seconds
```

## 📊 What to Monitor

### First 30 Minutes:
- [ ] Health endpoint responds (200 OK)
- [ ] Status page loads correctly
- [ ] API status shows "operational"
- [ ] Compression headers present
- [ ] No errors in browser console

### First 24 Hours:
- [ ] Health checks running every 5 minutes
- [ ] Request logs appearing
- [ ] Average response time < 200ms
- [ ] No 500 errors
- [ ] Database connections stable (~20)

### First Week:
- [ ] API uptime > 99%
- [ ] Error rate < 1%
- [ ] Bandwidth reduced by ~70%
- [ ] No user complaints
- [ ] Performance metrics stable

---

## 🔍 Key Metrics to Track

### Performance:
- **Response Time:** Target < 200ms (p95)
- **Database Queries:** Target < 50ms
- **API Calls:** Target < 100ms
- **Page Load:** Target < 2s

### Reliability:
- **Uptime:** Target 99.9%
- **Error Rate:** Target < 1%
- **Success Rate:** Target > 95%
- **API Health:** Should be "operational"

### Resources:
- **Database Connections:** ~20 active
- **Memory Usage:** Monitor for leaks
- **CPU Usage:** Should be < 50%
- **Bandwidth:** Should decrease ~70%

---

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Health Check Not Running
**Symptoms:** No "TextVerified API" logs

**Check:**
```bash
# Look for health check logs
grep "TextVerified API" app.log

# Should see entries every 5 minutes
```

**Solution:**
- Restart the service
- Check startup event fired
- Verify asyncio loop is running

---

### Issue 2: Compression Not Working
**Symptoms:** Large response sizes, no gzip header

**Check:**
```bash
# Check response headers
curl -I https://your-domain.com/services/list

# Should see: Content-Encoding: gzip
```

**Solution:**
- Verify GZipMiddleware is loaded
- Check minimum_size=1000 setting
- Clear browser cache

---

### Issue 3: Database Connection Errors
**Symptoms:** "Too many connections" errors

**Check:**
```bash
# Monitor active connections (PostgreSQL)
psql -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE datname='namaskah';"

# Should see ~20 connections
```

**Solution:**
- Increase pool_size if needed
- Check for connection leaks
- Verify pool_recycle is working

---

### Issue 4: Slow Response Times
**Symptoms:** Response times > 500ms

**Check:**
```bash
# Measure response time
time curl -s https://your-domain.com/services/list > /dev/null
```

**Solution:**
- Check database query performance
- Verify connection pooling is active
- Check for N+1 queries
- Monitor server resources

## 📝 Monitoring Commands

### Quick Health Check:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "🏥 Health Check"
curl -s https://your-domain.com/health | jq .

echo -e "\n📊 API Status"
curl -s https://your-domain.com/services/status | jq '.overall_status'

echo -e "\n⚡ Response Time"
time curl -s https://your-domain.com/services/list > /dev/null

echo -e "\n📦 Compression"
curl -I https://your-domain.com/services/list 2>&1 | grep -i "content-encoding"
```

### Continuous Monitoring:
```bash
# Watch health checks (run in terminal)
watch -n 60 'curl -s https://your-domain.com/health | jq .'

# Monitor logs (if you have access)
tail -f app.log | grep -E "(TextVerified|ERROR|WARNING)"
```

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Immediate (Day 1):
- [x] Code deployed successfully
- [ ] All endpoints responding
- [ ] Health checks running
- [ ] Compression working
- [ ] No critical errors

### Short-term (Week 1):
- [ ] Average response time < 200ms
- [ ] Error rate < 1%
- [ ] API uptime > 99%
- [ ] Bandwidth reduced 70%
- [ ] No user complaints

### Long-term (Month 1):
- [ ] 99.9% uptime achieved

- [ ] Alerts configured
- [ ] Ready for next improvements

---

## 🚨 Alert Thresholds

Set up alerts for:

1. **Response Time > 500ms** for 5 minutes
2. **Error Rate > 5%** for 5 minutes
3. **API Health = "down"** for 10 minutes
4. **Database Connections > 50** (pool exhausted)
5. **Memory Usage > 80%**
6. **CPU Usage > 80%** for 10 minutes

---

## 📞 Next Steps

### When Deployment is Live:

1. **Run verification steps** (above)
2. **Monitor for 30 minutes** (watch for errors)
3. **Check all metrics** (performance, reliability)
4. **Document any issues** (for troubleshooting)
5. **Plan next improvements** (split app.js, add tests)

### If Everything Works:

✅ Celebrate! You've successfully deployed production improvements!

Then proceed to:
- Split app.js into modules (2-3 hours)
- Add critical path tests (4-6 hours)
- Set up CI/CD pipeline (1 hour)
