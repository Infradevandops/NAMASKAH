# Admin Login Fix

## Issue
Admin login was failing with "Login Failed" error

## Root Cause
**Password hash was corrupted in the database**

The stored bcrypt hash didn't match the expected password `Admin@2024!`

## Investigation
```bash
✅ Admin found: admin@namaskah.app
Hash length: 60
Hash starts with: $2b$12$YOH
❌ Password 'Admin@2024!' is WRONG
```

## Solution
Reset the password hash in the database with correct bcrypt hash

## Fix Applied
```python
new_hash = bcrypt.hashpw('Admin@2024!'.encode('utf-8'), bcrypt.gensalt())
# Updated in database
```

## Verification
```bash
✅ VERIFIED: Password 'Admin@2024!' works correctly
✅ Admin: admin@namaskah.app
✅ You can now login
```

## Admin Credentials (Confirmed Working)
```
Email: admin@namaskah.app
Password: Admin@2024!
URL: /admin
```

## Why It Happened
Likely causes:
1. Password was changed during testing
2. Database was reset but password wasn't properly rehashed
3. Manual database edit corrupted the hash
4. Migration script didn't preserve the hash correctly

## Prevention
To avoid this in the future:
1. Always use `create_admin.py` script to reset admin password
2. Never manually edit password_hash in database
3. Use bcrypt library for all password operations

## Quick Reset Command
If this happens again, run:
```bash
python3 create_admin.py
```

This will:
- Reset admin password to `Admin@2024!`
- Ensure proper bcrypt hashing
- Verify the hash works

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Admin can now login successfully
